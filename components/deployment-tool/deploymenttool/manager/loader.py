        Loads Docker definitions from a service's service_description.json file.

        This function extracts Docker role and context definitions, updates image IDs 
        with the provided username, and identifies Docker images associated with 
        service artifacts.

        Args:
            build_path (str): The root path where the service build artifacts are located.
            service (str): The name of the service being processed.
            username (str): The username used to prefix Docker image IDs.

        Returns:
            tuple: A dictionary containing the parsed service description and a list of tuples 
                with image IDs and their corresponding paths.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the service description file is missing, contains invalid JSON, 
                        or any other unexpected error occurs.
